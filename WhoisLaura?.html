She also speaks Spanish, sings in a reinessance choir, plays guitar, and African percussion. Laura is always looking for a new skill to master, and is now turning her sights to coding and webdesign to bring her creativty and passion for conservation to the software development world. She hopes to create tools, apps, and compelling interactive websites for non-profits and scientists to faciliate engagement with a public who is becoming increasingly detached from our natural environment. She believes technology can serve as a bridge between the world outside and the world within.</p>
